== ToDo ==

[x] optimization of the add_folder operation: if the command supports all the
    requested options add the folder directly instead of reading the folder 
    and adding the content in chunks.
    
    Partially fixed for the commands that allow to specify the file list
    in a file, that is: tar, rar, 7zip.
    
[ ] #525274 – File roller seems to be unable to create zipfiles without .zip extension

[ ] #512825 – Fails extraction of files within directories named '.'

[ ] #508737 – can't add file to the archive if archive name is without extension

[ ] #482560 – totem-like plugin installer for file-roller

[x] #153281 – Progress bar should be exact

    This is command dependent: fixed for tar, zip, 7zip, rar.

[ ] #543225 – File-Roller is unable to open gzip-compressed files like pci.ids if they are missing an .gz extension
   
[ ] It's not possible to load, modify, extract remote multi-volume archives.

[?] #501660 – File-roller nautilus extension creates tarbombs

[x] #503940 – Various Archive Manager documentation mistakes
