== ToDo ==

[ ] optimization of the add_folder operation: if the command supports all the
    requested options add the folder directly instead of reading the folder 
    and adding the content in chunks.

[ ] #343201 – Use p7zip for RAR archives?

[ ] #529395 – file-roller will not open 256 AES zip files
    --> use 7z for zip archives (see #515194 – PK 4.5 Zip files).
    
[ ] #525274 – File roller seems to be unable to create zipfiles without .zip extension

[ ] #520844 – File roller not cancelling compression

[ ] #512825 – Fails extraction of files within directories named '.'

[ ] #508737 – can't add file to the archive if archive name is without extension

[ ] #519046 – add x-cbr and x-cbz support

[ ] #521324 – ALZ archive support

[ ] #482560 – totem-like plugin installer for file-roller
