This file contains some instructions on how to use the command line arguments.


Extraction
----------

1) Extract an archive to a specified directory:

	file-roller --extract-to=/path/to/dir archive.tgz

   create the destination folder without asking the user to confirm

   	file-roller --force --extract-to=/path/to/dir archive.tgz

2) Extract an archive letting the user choose the destination directory:

	file-roller --extract archive.tgz

   set the directory to show in the folder chooser dialog:

	file-roller --default-dir=/path/to/show --extract archive.tgz

3) Extract an archive in its parent folder creating a subfolder if the archive
   contains more than one top level object (that is avoiding the tar-bombing).
   This is the same command used in the Nautilus context menu to extract
   archives.

   	file-roller --extract-here archive.tgz

Use the --notify option to show a dialog that notifies the user that the
operation has completed successfully and allows to open the destination folder.

You can extract a series of archives with a single command.


Compression
-----------

1) Compress a series of files specifying the archive name:

	file-roller --add-to=/path/to/archive.tgz file1 file2 ..

   the archive is created if it doesn't exist.

2) Compress a series of files letting the user choose the archive name:

	file-roller --add file1 file2 ..

   set the directory to show in the folder chooser dialog:

	file-roller --default-dir=/path/to/show --add file1 file2 ..

Use the --notify option to show a dialog that notifies the user that the
operation has completed successfully and allows to open the created archive.
